EMX
===
EMX is a framework proposing an architecture for working with single-page AJAX-based applications which might get resource intensive. The framework is designed on top the MVC pattern and comes with an innovative approach to inversion of control and dependency injection.

The framework was also aimed at streamlining the way things are done in PHP and JavaScript, and making the work with AJAX applications as painless as possible.

The last goal for the framework was a simple unit testing framework utilizing the dependency injection pattern to create object mocks.
